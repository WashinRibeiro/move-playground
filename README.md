> In this example, I explored how to build and interact with a Move package on the Sui blockchain.  
> I learned how to **create and build a new package**, **set up an account**, **request test tokens**, and **publish a smart contract**.  
> I also analyzed **transaction data, effects, events, and object balance changes** to better understand how operations are processed on the Sui blockchain.  
> Finally, I practiced **sending transactions**, **passing objects to functions**, and **chaining multiple commands in a single block**, completing a full hands-on journey into Move on Sui.
